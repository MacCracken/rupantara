#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bench-history.sh — run rupantara's benchmarks and append the results to
# bench-history.csv, one row per benchmark, stamped with the date and VERSION.
#
# This is the baseline tool of the first-party P(-1) process: run it before a
# hardening or optimization pass and again after, and compare the two stamps.
# Adapted from rosnet's script of the same name (1.2.2).
#
# Each benchmark is the median of RUNS runs (default 3). On a laptop-class host
# the same binary moves by a few percent between runs, so a single run can hide
# or invent a difference. Compare rows only when they were recorded in the same
# session on the same host; docs/benchmarks.md says which rows were.
#
# It runs the benchmark exactly as CI does:
#   CYRIUS_DCE=1 cyrius bench tests/rupantara.bcyr
# and parses lib/bench.cyr's `bench_report` line, whose label may contain
# spaces, parentheses and commas:
#   "  ru_head_fwd_row C=768 V=12564 (1/4 LM head row): 8.785ms avg (min=… max=…) [10 iters]"
# The label is written to the CSV in double quotes.
